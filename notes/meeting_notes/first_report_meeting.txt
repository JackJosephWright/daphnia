to complete single daphnia;


are we going to impute the data for them?


are we going to give a python package/ just the repo


MAJOR PROBLEMS:

disjoint data to start the process. 
need more data








thresholding:

optical flow



to do:


remake histograms with all tracking data to identify max velos

set up and document repo for use by researchers

get more videos to start looking at preproessing
