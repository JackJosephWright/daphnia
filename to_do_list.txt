Write down any new tasks to completegit

TODO IDEAS:


check if y#wcentroid is the same as Y etc...









CURRENT MAIN TODO:



2. add new zip functions to src
    -modify zip.py for the final src file
    -install pytest
    -tutorial on pytest
    -write 2 normal case tests
    -write 2 edge case tests


3. write function to standardize plotting of the fish df. 
    -do a tutorial on matplotlib 
    -do a quick tutorial on pandas dataframes
    -plot graph 


GETTING CLEAN DATA:

    Ibrahim


    GOAL: get a reasonable estimate of the daphnia top speed for our data cleaning function

    1. visual inspection of "C:\Users\jwright\Documents\GitHub\daphnia\data\npz_file\single_7_9_fish1.MP4_fish0.npz" to be called "fm1"
        make sure there arent any obvious jumps and the data looks ok. (missing is fine, no jumps)

    2. cut the data into separate tables (if there is missing data, start a new table)

    3. look at the distribution of lengths (how long each segment is, you could do the last row's t - the first rows t)
        throw out the tables that are too short
    4. calculate the velocity (d/t) between every point in the good data. plot this as a distribution

    5. come up with a reasonable estimate for the daphnias TOP SPEED

FUNCTION TO REMOVE JUMPS FROM THE DATA:

    guiliano

    
    GOAL: apply a function to a fish df that will remove any discontinuities and give us jumpless data to impute

    function should:
    take in 3 arguments, p_o (the previous validated point) p_n the next unvalidated point and vmax (max fish velocity)

    calculate the velocity by calculating the distance between p_o and p_n divide by the time between the measurements

    return true or false if the data is valuidated


    SECOND FUNCTION:

    apply the validator function to the dataframe. if the point is valid, add it to the output DF, if not Documents




LARGER GOALS:



outline missing data:

    goal:

    fill in missing data in in one of the files inside the .npz with some strategy for data imputation

    process:

    locate the .npz file: 

    unzip the file:

    combine vectors in unzipped npz into a table 

    *decide how to define a missing segment* 


    want:

    argument in function that accepts an imputation strategy
