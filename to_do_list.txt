Write down any new tasks to completegit

TODO IDEAS:









CURRENT MAIN TODO:


guiliano

create synthetic data to test the imputer. add to a test_TRexImputer file

create simple imputer (add a nonsense value that plots where you can see it)

plot the results to checgik it

start on avg value imputer 

this goes in the imputation strategy folder, it should fill values with an avg velocity to connect two disconnected segments



3. write function to standardize plotting of the fish df. 
    -do a tutorial on matplotlib 
    -do a quick tutorial on pandas dataframes
    -plot graph 


GETTING CLEAN DATA:

    Ibrahim


    GOAL: get a reasonable estimate of the daphnia top speed for our data cleaning function

   
    2. cut the data into separate tables (if there is missing data, start a new table)

    3. look at the distribution of lengths (how long each segment is, you could do the last row's t - the first rows t)
        throw out the tables that are too short
    4. calculate the velocity (d/t) between every point in the good data. plot this as a distribution

    5. come up with a reasonable estimate for the daphnias TOP SPEED





LARGER GOALS:



outline missing data:

    goal:

    fill in missing data in in one of the files inside the .npz with some strategy for data imputation

    process:

    locate the .npz file: 

    unzip the file:

    combine vectors in unzipped npz into a table 

    *decide how to define a missing segment* 


    want:

    argument in function that accepts an imputation strategy
