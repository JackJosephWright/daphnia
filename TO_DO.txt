-turn visualization stuff into a class, put in tutorials folder
-add all visualization functions into a class. 
-write tests for all methods in `tests` folder
-finalize class and save in `src`



tasks:

1- learn about python classes (w3schools)
2- do a tutorial on building a class

Macro plan:

SHARING THE REPO

get repo documented and build a tutorial

fork for David and co...

-can you compile a package easily 

-do a tutorial

-package the repo and test it




DOCUMENTATION



?sphynx? documentation for the project, if not

use the report structure to create a jupyter notebook FUNCTIONING documentation with 


example documentation for a method in a class:

https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html


other idea: put it in a google colab to make the documentation interactive
