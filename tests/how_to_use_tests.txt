The repo is now set up as a package to make importing stuff easier


How to run files:

in order for imports to work properly, you have to run the python 
file in the terminal as a module.

make sure your current working directory is the root


RUNNING REGULAR FILES

EXAMPLE:

MAC

python -m tests.test_NPZer (no .py necessary since this is a module)


PC:

py -m tests.test_NPZer




RUNNING A PYTEST


just use the normal slashing stcture for running in the terminal

EXAMPLE:

pytest tests/test_NPZer.py
