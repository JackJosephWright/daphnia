FUNCTION TO REMOVE JUMPS FROM THE DATA:

    guiliano

    
    GOAL: apply a function to a fish df that will remove any discontinuities and give us jumpless data to impute

    function should:
    take in 3 arguments, p_o (the previous validated point) p_n the next unvalidated point and vmax (max fish velocity)

    calculate the velocity by calculating the distance between p_o and p_n divide by the time between the measurements

    return true or false if the data is valuidated


    SECOND FUNCTION:

    apply the validator function to the dataframe. if the point is valid, add it to the output DF, if not Documents


2. create csv from unzipped .npz
    -giuliano
    create a dummy .npz file and write a function to unzip it. 
    -create 1-d arrays x, y, time
    -zip into .npz
    -unzip with function
    -concatinate into table with pandas
    FUNCTION TO REMOVE JUMPS FROM THE DATA:

2. add new zip functions to src
    -modify zip.py for the final src file
    -install pytest
    -tutorial on pytest
    -write 2 normal case tests
    -write 2 edge case tests

3. get python on everyones computer


1. create .npz file from single_fish.mp4
    -ibrahim



1. create .npz file from single_fish.mp4
    -ibrahim

4. add mirror argument to pandafy function
    -do the mirroring


4. get important packages downloaded (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, numpy)
