FUNCTION TO REMOVE JUMPS FROM THE DATA:

    guiliano

    
    GOAL: apply a function to a fish df that will remove any discontinuities and give us jumpless data to impute

    function should:
    take in 3 arguments, p_o (the previous validated point) p_n the next unvalidated point and vmax (max fish velocity)

    calculate the velocity by calculating the distance between p_o and p_n divide by the time between the measurements

    return true or false if the data is valuidated


    SECOND FUNCTION:

    apply the validator function to the dataframe. if the point is valid, add it to the output DF, if not Documents


2. create csv from unzipped .npz
    -giuliano
    create a dummy .npz file and write a function to unzip it. 
    -create 1-d arrays x, y, time
    -zip into .npz
    -unzip with function
    -concatinate into table with pandas
    FUNCTION TO REMOVE JUMPS FROM THE DATA:

2. add new zip functions to src
    -modify zip.py for the final src file
    -install pytest
    -tutorial on pytest
    -write 2 normal case tests
    -write 2 edge case tests

3. get python on everyones computer


1. create .npz file from single_fish.mp4
    -ibrahim



1. create .npz file from single_fish.mp4
    -ibrahim

4. add mirror argument to pandafy function
    -do the mirroring


4. get important packages downloaded (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, numpy)
   1. visual inspection of "C:\Users\jwright\Documents\GitHub\daphnia\data\npz_file\single_7_9_fish1.MP4_fish0.npz" to be called "fm1"
        make sure there arent any obvious jumps and the data looks ok. (missing is fine, no jumps)





Write down any new tasks to completegit




2. add new zip functions to src
    -modify zip.py for the final src file
    -install pytest
    -tutorial on pytest
    -write 2 normal case tests
    -write 2 edge case tests

X. add a section to the readme.txt on how to merge the main branch changes into another branch


3. write function to standardize plotting of the fish df. 
    -do a tutorial on matplotlib  DONE
    -do a quick tutorial on pandas dataframes
    -use unzipper  to unzip .npz file
    -plot graph of npz data
    -write a function that takes in a dataframe and plots the fish
    -discussion on refactoring this:

4. add mirror argument to pandafy function
    -do the mirroring
    


4. get important packages downloaded (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, numpy)

outline missing data:

    goal:

    fill in missing data in in one of the files inside the .npz with some strategy for data imputation

    process:

    locate the .npz file: 

    unzip the file:

    combine vectors in unzipped npz into a table 

    *decide how to define a missing segment* 


    want:

    argument in function that accepts an imputation strategy
